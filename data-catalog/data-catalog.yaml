    title: Pan-European Dataset for Energy System Planning
    description: |
      This dataset contains information about the following sectors in Europe:

      . Variable Renewable Energy
      . Hydro, reservoirs and run-of-river
      . Biomass
      . Energy conversion and storage
      . Electricity transmission (cross-border)
      . Methane and hydrogen
      . Cargo transport, biomass, hydrocarbon liquids and methanol
      . Industry, chemicals, glass, fertilisers, refineries, cement and steel
      . Buildings, non-residential and residential, heating and cooling
      . Transport, road, train, aviation and shipping
      . Residual electricity demand

      The dataset must be opened through SpineToolbox (from v0.11.0, spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox: Spine Toolbox is an open source Python package to manage data, scenarios and workflows for modelling and simulation. You can have your local workflow, but work as a team through version control and SQL databases.).

      The main folder contains and configurable file (userconfig.yml) to develop the target model. In principle, running INES builder tool, the user will get the whole Pan-European model at country resolution for onshore and seabasin-country resolution for offshore. The target model is formatted through an interoperable energy system specification (INES, ines-tools/ines-spec: Interoperable energy system data specification).

      This dataset includes data of EU27 plus UK, CH and NO.

    title: Mopo pan-European VRE data - Climate change projections
    description: |
      This dataset provides simulated hourly wind and solar PV generation time series used in the Mopo project for pan‑European energy system modeling. The modeling framework follows https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950647 (validated in Nayak et al. (2025)), extended here to run on climate projections.
      Climate inputs come from two models from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (2024): MPI‑ESM1‑2‑HR (MEHR)and EC‑Earth3 (ECE3). For each model, two scenarios are simulated: SSP2‑4.5, representing an intermediate “middle‑of‑the‑road” pathway, and SSP5‑8.5, representing a very high‑emission pathway. This yields four climate projections covering 2015–2100 at hourly resolution. Following Luzia (2023), wind speeds in all projections are scaled using GWA2.

      Each climate projection includes:

          Solar PV: 3 simulated PV technologies.
          Offshore wind: 4 specific technologies (2 bottom‑fixed (FB) and 2 floating (FO)) plus an “existing” configuration.
          Onshore wind: 9 specific technologies plus an “existing” configuration.

      “Existing” runs represent installations characteristic of 2020 in the analyzed regions, while “specific technology” runs represent possible future VRE installations. See https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950647 for more details about the simulated VRE technologies and regions.

      == MopoHeatSectorDataProcessing/output

      Output produced by MopoHeatSectorDataProcessing, provided as a separate repository due to its size not really befitting a GitHub repository.

      Most of the contents of this description are copied from `MopoHeatSectorDataProcessing/output/README.md`, so all the references might not make sense within the context of just these output files.
      ## cop-timeseries/*.csv

      Hourly timeseries for different heat pump coefficients of performance for different countries, calculated using the Mopo AmBIENCE2ABM Demo. Note that the COP approximation uses a rather crude constant exergy Carnot method.
      Contains 5 weather years:

          1995
          2008
          2009
          2012
          2015

      Contains 8 different COP timeseries:

          `A2AHP-air` space heating using an air-to-air heat pump (`A2AHP`).
          `A2AHP-cooling` space cooling using an air-to-air heat pump.
          `A2WHP-DHW` domestic hot water (`DHW`) heating using an air-to-water heat pump (`A2WHP`).
          `A2WHP-floor` space heating using an air-to-water heat pump assuming a low-temperature heat distribution system (e.g. hydronic floor heating).
          `A2WHP-radiators` space heating using an air-to-water heat pump assuming a medium-temperature heat distribution system (e.g. modern hydronic radiators).
          `G2WHP-DHW` domestic hot water heating using an ground-to-water heat pump (`G2WHP`).
          `G2WHP-floor` space heating using an ground-to-water heat pump assuming a low-temperature heat distribution system (e.g. hydronic floor heating).
          `G2WHP-radiators` space heating using an ground-to-water heat pump assuming a medium-temperature heat distribution system (e.g. modern hydronic radiators).

      Produced by `cop_export.ipynb` with more details on how the data is reorganized from the raw ArchetypeBuildingModel output.
      === `demand-timeseries/*.csv`

      Normalised hourly timeseries for the useful energy demand for space `heating` and `cooling`, as well as domestic hot water (`DHW`) heating for different countries, calculated using the Mopo AmBIENCE2ABM Demo. The demands are also provided for residential (`res`) and nonresidential (`nonres`) buildings separately. Note that the timeseries are rather crude due to the underlying assumptions and shortcomings of ArchetypeBuildingModel.

      The timeseries are normalised such that when scaled with a yearly demand in GWh, the resulting timeseries will represent hourly demand in MW. Note that in order to preserve the variations in heating/cooling demands between weather years, the timeseries are normalised using their average yearly demand, and thus do not sum to 1. This roughly corresponds to the approach used in the Hotmaps project when projecting future heating/cooling demand scenarios, where average weather for 2002-2012 was used.
      Produced by `demand_scaling.ipynb` with more details on how the demand timeseries are processed from the raw ArchetypeBuildingModel output.
      === `heat_storage_params.csv`
      Parameters for select heat storage technologies based on the
      Danish Energy Agency technology catalogues. Produced by `process_storage_data.ipynb` with more details on how the DEA data is mapped, aggregated, and processed into the desired technology parameters.
      === `heat_technology_params.csv`
      District heating system and distributed heating technology parameters based on the
      Danish Energy Agency technology catalogues. Produced by `process_generation_data.ipynb` with more details on how the DEA data is mapped, aggregated, and processed into the desired technology parameters.
      === `peak_to_yearly_demand_ratios_MW_GWh.csv`
      Maximum peak heating/cooling demand (MW) to yearly heating/cooling demand (GWh) ratios across the modelled weather years. Used for estimating the capacities of both distributed heating systems as well as heat-only boilers in district heating production across Europe. Produced by `demand_scaling.ipynb` with more details on how these are calculated based on the raw ArchetypeBuildingModel output.
      === `scenario_estimated_existing_capacities_MW.csv`

      Estimated heating/cooling technology capacities in MW based on the Hotmaps project results as well as the peak-to-yearly-demand ratios of the ArchetypeBuildingModel. Essentially just multiplies the yearly demand by the estimated peak demand for distributed heating capacities. District heating heat-only boiler capacities estimated based on fuel distributions in the JRC-IDEES 2015 (for UK only) and 2021 datasets.

      NOTE! The existing heating capacities of the heat pumps are pretty volatile, as the `Electricity` vs `ambient heat` ratios in the Hotmaps data is all over the place. For most cases this is hopefully ok, but for some rows the estimated COP reaches hundreds and thousands, which is unrealistic. Quirks of statistics, I suppose.

      Produced by `process_capacity_data.ipynb` with more details on how the capacities are mapped and estimated.
      === `scenario_total_yearly_demands_GWh.csv`

      Total yearly space heating/cooling and domestic hot water heating demands based on the Hotmaps project results. These are used to scale the heating/cooling demand profiles to match a desired yearly scenario demand.

      NOTE! While Norway and Switzerland are included, they don't have real scenario data in the Hotmaps results. Instead, their demands are based on neighbouring countries and scaled based on population.

      Produced by `demand_scaling.ipynb` with more details on how the Hotmaps data is extended and aggregated.
      === `simplified_capacities_with_decommissioning_MW.csv`

      Further processed simplified existing capacities from `scenario_estimated_existing_capacities_MW` for Mopo WP5. Unlike the aforementioned file, the future capacities here are not based on the Hotmaps project results except for the first year. Instead, the capacities for the remaining years are estimated based on approximate decommissioning rates calculated from the `lifetime_y` parameter in the `heating_technology_params.csv`.

      Also note that these capacities are totals over the `building_category` and heating/DHW `demand`. `demand_category` and cooling `demand` are still separate due to different `technology` serving them. The `scenario` is currently selected as `current`.

      Produced by `process_capacity_data.ipynb`.
